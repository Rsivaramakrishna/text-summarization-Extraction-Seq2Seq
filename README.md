# text-summarization-Extraction-Seq2Seq
Overview
This project implements a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for text summarization and extraction. The Seq2Seq model is a type of neural network architecture widely used for tasks involving sequential data, such as machine translation and text summarization. In this project, we leverage the power of Seq2Seq to automatically generate concise summaries of longer texts and extract key information.

Features
Text Summarization: Given a longer piece of text, the model generates a shorter summary that captures the essential information.
Text Extraction: Identifies and extracts important information from the input text, providing structured output.
Customizable: The model can be trained on various datasets and fine-tuned for specific domains or languages.
Scalable: Designed to handle large volumes of text data efficiently, making it suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated into existing applications or used via a simple API for text summarization and extraction needs.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
tqdm (for progress bars)
Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your text data for training. This typically involves preprocessing and organizing the data into suitable formats.
Model Training: Train the Seq2Seq model using your prepared dataset. Adjust hyperparameters and architecture as needed.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using relevant metrics such as ROUGE scores for summarization tasks.
Inference: Deploy the trained model for inference. Provide input text to generate summaries or extract information.
Integration: Integrate the model into your applications or workflows. You can expose the functionality via APIs or use it directly within your codebase.
Example
python
Copy code
from text_summarization import Seq2SeqSummarizer

# Initialize the summarizer

# Load trained model weights

# Generate summary for input text
